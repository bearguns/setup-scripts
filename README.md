# Setup Scripts

These script files were created to help me setup a new macOS system quickly and consistently. Many of the items in these scripts are Mac-specific, so YMMV using these on other *nix systems.

## Checklist

1. Clone this repo and my dotfiles
2. Execute `.newmac` to put the most important players in place.
3. Execute `$ brew bundle` from the same directory as the Brewfile
4. Execute `$ sh .macos`
5. Enjoy!
